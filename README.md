## Enhanced Logging System

The Dots features a comprehensive logging system that:

- Records all installation and configuration activities
- Maintains silent logging for installation messages unless there's an error
- Provides detailed logs for troubleshooting
- Integrates with all print functions for consistent output

All logs are stored in `$HOME/dots/logs/` with timestamps and log levels.

## Advanced Configuration Management System

The dots features a sophisticated configuration management system that ensures optimal loading order and prevents conflicts between different tools and languages.

### Load Order Management

The system uses `00_load_order.zsh` to control the sequence of configuration file loading:

1. **Framework First**: Starship prompt loads first to establish the shell framework
2. **Core Exports**: General environment variables are loaded early
3. **Language Dependencies**: Languages load in dependency order (Java before Kotlin, etc.)
4. **Tool Configurations**: Development tools load after languages
5. **Aliases**: General aliases load last to allow overrides
6. **Cloud Services**: External services load after core tools
7. **Final Initializations**: Miscellaneous tools load last

### Dependency Resolution

The system automatically handles dependencies between configurations:
- **Java → Kotlin**: Kotlin configuration loads after Java since it depends on the JVM
- **Python → Conda**: Conda loads after Python for environment management
- **Node.js → NPM/Yarn**: Package managers load after Node.js installation

### Conflict Detection and Resolution

Built-in alias conflict detection system:
- Documents known conflicts between tools
- Provides resolution strategies
- Prevents duplicate alias definitions
- Maintains clean shell environment

### Configuration Files Structure

All configuration files are stored in `$HOME/dots/macos/configs/shell/zsh_configs/`:

| File | Purpose | Load Order |
|------|---------|------------|
| `00_load_order.zsh` | Load order management and conflict detection | 1 |
| `starship.zsh` | Starship prompt initialization | 2 |
| `exports.zsh` | General environment variables | 3 |
| `java.zsh` | Java, SDKMAN, Maven, Gradle | 4 |
| `python.zsh` | Python, pyenv, UV package manager | 5 |
| `ruby.zsh` | Ruby, rbenv, bundler | 6 |
| `rust.zsh` | Rust, Cargo | 7 |
| `go.zsh` | Go language and tools | 8 |
| `swift.zsh` | Swift compiler and tools | 9 |
| `kotlin.zsh` | Kotlin (depends on Java) | 10 |
| `node.zsh` | Node.js, NVM | 11 |
| `php.zsh` | PHP, Composer | 12 |
| `cpp.zsh` | C/C++, LLVM | 13 |
| `homebrew.zsh` | Homebrew package manager | 14 |
| `xcode.zsh` | Xcode development tools | 15 |
| `docker.zsh` | Docker and Docker Compose | 16 |
| `gpg.zsh` | GPG encryption tools | 17 |
| `anthropic.zsh` | Anthropic MCP server and tools | 18 |
| `ipfs.zsh` | IPFS decentralized storage | 19 |
| `cli_tools.zsh` | CLI tools configuration and aliases | 20 |
| `aliases.zsh` | General aliases and shortcuts | 21 |
| `gcloud.zsh` | Google Cloud SDK | 22 |
| `conda.zsh` | Conda package manager | 23 |
| `misc.zsh` | Final initializations (WezTerm, etc.) | 24 |

### Benefits of This Approach

- **Prevents Conflicts**: Load order prevents tool conflicts and duplicate definitions
- **Dependency Management**: Automatic handling of tool dependencies
- **Easy Maintenance**: Individual configuration files are easy to modify or disable
- **Performance Optimization**: Optimal loading sequence for fastest shell startup
- **Debugging Support**: Clear load order makes troubleshooting easier
- **Modular Design**: Each tool has its own isolated configuration space

Feel free to send suggestions, corrections, and feedback. I'll accept pull requests that add value to the project, as long as they're constructive and respectful.

## Duplicate Prevention System

This project includes a centralized tool registry system to prevent duplicate installations across different scripts:

### Tool Registry Features
- **Conflict Detection**: Automatically detects when tools are installed in multiple scripts
- **Centralized Management**: Single source of truth for all tool installations
- **Dependency Tracking**: Tracks tool categories and installation methods
- **Resolution System**: Provides tools to resolve conflicts between scripts

### Registry Functions
- `register_tool()` - Register a tool installation
- `check_tool_conflict()` - Detect duplicate installations
- `resolve_tool_conflict()` - Handle conflicts between scripts
- `list_registered_tools()` - View all registered tools
- `list_conflicts()` - View any detected conflicts

### Script Organization
- **Specialized Scripts**: Comprehensive installation + configuration (e.g., `wezterm.zsh`)
- **General Scripts**: Basic installation only, no configuration
- **Core Scripts**: Shared dependencies (e.g., `core_ai_tools.zsh`)

### Recent Changes
- ✅ Removed duplicate WezTerm installations (kept comprehensive `wezterm.zsh`)
- ✅ Consolidated communication tools into flexible `communication_tools.zsh`
- ✅ Created `core_ai_tools.zsh` for shared AI package dependencies
- ✅ Removed duplicate programming language installations from general scripts
- ✅ Removed duplicate database tool installations
- ✅ Merged communication tools with simple/comprehensive modes

## GNU Stow Implementation for Dots

This document describes the GNU Stow implementation that replaces the manual directory creation and symbolic link functionality in the dots setup.

### Overview

GNU Stow is a symlink farm manager that helps manage configuration files by creating symbolic links from a central location to their target destinations. This implementation replaces the previous manual directory creation and symlink scripts with a more robust and maintainable solution.

### Directory Structure

```
