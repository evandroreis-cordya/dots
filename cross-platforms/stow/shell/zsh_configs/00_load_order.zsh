# CONFIGURATION LOAD ORDER
#==============================================================================
# This file defines the optimal loading sequence for all configuration files
# to avoid conflicts and ensure proper initialization.
#
# Loading Order:
# 1. This file (00_load_order.zsh) - defines the load order
# 2. ohmyzsh.zsh - Oh My Zsh framework (must load first)
# 3. exports.zsh - General environment variables
# 4. Language configurations (alphabetically, but dependencies respected)
#    - java.zsh (includes SDKMAN, Maven, Gradle)
#    - python.zsh (includes pyenv, UV)
#    - ruby.zsh (includes rbenv, bundler)
#    - rust.zsh (includes cargo)
#    - go.zsh
#    - swift.zsh
#    - kotlin.zsh (depends on java)
#    - node.zsh (includes NVM)
#    - php.zsh (includes composer)
#    - cpp.zsh
# 5. Tool configurations
#    - homebrew.zsh
#    - xcode.zsh
#    - docker.zsh
#    - gpg.zsh
#    - anthropic.zsh
#    - ipfs.zsh
# 6. aliases.zsh - General aliases (loads after language configs)
# 7. Cloud/external services
#    - gcloud.zsh
#    - conda.zsh
# 8. misc.zsh - Final initializations (WezTerm, Jina, etc.)
#
# Files are automatically loaded by .zshrc but in a specific order
# to prevent conflicts and ensure optimal performance.
